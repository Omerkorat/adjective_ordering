4,English,2,Male,35,"I love language and would love to know what you were studying. It seemed to me that during this exercise, I realized that some adjectives sound more natural coming first when paired with another. ""Thick"" was one of those adjectives that I thought about. I really find language interesting.  I studied Spanish for a couple years, then got an Associate degree in Deaf Communication / Interpreting. In later college years I took other language courses that really opened my eyes to how in depth and complex the rule systems of our language are and how we apply rules without even thinking. Anyway... I enjoyed this HIT. Would be interested to learn what exactly you&quotecharre studying and what your findings were. ",Yes,2
