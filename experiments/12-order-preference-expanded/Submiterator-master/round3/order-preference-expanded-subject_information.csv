8,English,1,Female,38,"Maybe if you had an optional comments box for each pair because there were a few that I had a comment about, like what if both phrases worked OK. Also, when you say neither makes sense, I had a question. If I say for example, The Green Choir Dog. Is this a phrase that does not make sense? Or is the sentence technically OK, even though it is highly unlikely that a green Choir Dog exists? In other words, when you say does it make sense, do you mean technically, could the words go together? Or is the object the words describe feasible?",Yes,3
