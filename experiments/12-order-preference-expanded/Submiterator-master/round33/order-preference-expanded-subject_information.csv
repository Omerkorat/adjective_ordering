3,English,2,Female,54,"Several examples in, I started to think that I might not have taken in some essential instruction. At first I thought I was being asked if it made sense (along with being natural), as if the words were used properly--something someone might say. Then it began to appear that they were randomly paired up words--that none of them would ""make sense""--so i began to wonder in what sense I was asked if they made sense and if that was an important question rather than just if they sounded natural or not, or which sounded more natural. I mean, there were at least two questions being asked of me and how did they relate exactly. Would have liked to see an example to try to figure out what you meant by making sense and what you meant by more natural. Yes I read the instructions. The instructions didn&quotechart have any context. The context appeared only when the questions started. Again, I understand what ""sounds more natural"" means and I understand what ""makes sense"" means but applying them at the same time (simultaneously) is confusing and made me ask myself if I had understood the instructions or not.",Confused,4
