2,vietnamese,2,Male,28,"It&quotechars interesting how the same adjectival word order and word choice affects how naturally a statement sounds depending on the noun (e.g. spicy pan vs spicy college). So while it&quotechars tempting to say that I generally found a statement with the adjective ending it ""-y"" to be more natural at the start of the statement, it wasn&quotechart always true depending on the following noun. I think (speculatively) that it&quotechars because I associate words ending in ""-y"" to automatically be an adverb, and therefore want it as close to the verb as possible syntactically. And since verbs are typically towards the beginning of the statement in English (Sub-Verb-Obj order), it makes intuitive sense for the adjective resembling the adverb to be nearer to the beginning of any statement.
