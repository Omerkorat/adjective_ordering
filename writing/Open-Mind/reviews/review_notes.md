1. The discussion/framing of **other approaches to adjective ordering** needs some attention: unmentioned hypotheses, framing as syntactic vs. semantic, online decisions vs. conventionalizations.
2. There ought to be **direct quantitative comparison** between our hypothesis (i.e., subjectivity) and others.
3. **Clarify the explanation** or admit that the hypothesis is based purely on descriptive adequacy

#### Reviewer 1

1. **Situate the hypothesis within other current approaches**: subsectivity, apparentness, inherentness, etc. If I am to buy the explanation of subjectivity, I want some additional data that allow a comparison.
2. Why does subjectivity perform so **poorly in the second experiment**?
3. The hypothesis that **complex concept formation** is involved to a significant degree cannot be ruled out.
4. The proposed psychological mechnaism (i.e., the explanation) seems counterintuitive, given the **mirror image effect** cross-linguistically.

#### Reviewer 2

1. I would find the papper much more convincing if there were a **model comparison** with the predictions of the class-based approaches (e.g., Dixon or Cinque)  and other semantic-y approaches (e.g., inherentness).
2. The authors set things up as a debate between syntax and semantics, but that's a **conflation of two distinct  questions**:
	1. What is the **explanation** for why certain (types of) adjectives occur closer to nouns than others?
	2. What is the **formalization/representation/conventionalizaiton** of these ordering preferences in the syntax?
3. Do we predict that subjectivity -- and therefore order preference -- should **vary with context?**
4. I find the **explanation** offered very unconvincing.

#### Reviewer 3

1. How do **other theories** do on this type of data? Does subjectivity matter over and above other factors?
2. Why should we think that anything abstract determines ordering preferences -- couldn't it all boil down to frequency (i.e., **a usage-based approach**)? If subjectivity really matters, it should matter for novel words, too. What if you gave a new word and varied the subjectivity of its meaning -- would you see ordering preferences vary with meaning?


#### to do

- concept formability
- subsective vs. intersective (at most a binary distinction)
- clean up language of synchronic vs. diachronic / conventionalization / design vs. processing
