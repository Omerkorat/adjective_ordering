\maketitle

Compositional (i.e., semantic) accounts of ordering preferences hold that the fundamental factor in predicting adjective ordering is whether or not an adjective is used to form a complex concept/subkind description: first you form the concept, then you modify it with additional adjectives (McNally and Boleda, 2004; Svenonius, 2008).\footnote{Bouchard 2005 makes a similar claim, namely that the formation of complex concepts can override adjective ordering preferences.} 
This would imply that an interaction between the noun and a modifying adjective---whether they combine to form a complex concept---should have a large influence on adjective ordering. 
Indeed, a more general hypothesis is that \emph{some} interaction between a noun and adjective will influence how closely the adjective is placed to that noun. This interaction could be caused by concept-formation, differential subjectivity, or other factors. We tested for such an interaction in our original naturalness ratings and found that noun-specific naturalness did not explain any variance in ordering preference above and beyond adjective-level naturalness. However, there were two adjective-noun pairs in our data with trends in the predicted direction: the naturalness ratings for \emph{hard} and \emph{soft} suggested a preference to occur closer to the noun \emph{cheese}. (Plausibly because hard and soft cheeses are complex concepts.) While these adjective-noun interactions do not survive correction for multiple comparisons in our statistical analysis, they do indicate that a different set of materials might reveal by-noun effects on ordering preference. To follow up on this possibility, we re-ran our order preference and subjectivity experiments with a new set of materials that were chosen to maximize the probability of noun effects.


\section*{Experiment S1: Ordering preferences}

This experiment was a direct replication of our original naturalness ratings experiment (Experiment 1), using a different set of nouns. We chose nouns that we expected to form complex concepts with the given adjectives and therefore yield effects on ordering preferences.

\paragraph{Participants.}

We recruited 50 participants through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing service. Participants were compensated for their participation.

\paragraph{Design and methods.}

The design was identical to our original naturalness ratings experiment: participants were asked to indicate which of two object descriptions sounded more natural, using a sliding scale. Each description featured a noun modified by two adjectives; description pairs contained the same words with the relative adjective order reversed (e.g., ``the big blue thing'' vs.~``the blue big thing''). Adjectives were chosen at random from the original set of 26. The nouns were a smaller set of five (compared to the original ten). Nouns were chosen to maximize the probability of detecting noun-specific effects on adjective ordering preferences. In particular, we expected that nouns that are likely to form complex concepts should be 
highly collocational with that adjective. We thus searched for nouns that occur in particular adjective-noun phrases more frequently than predicted by the individual noun and adjective probabilities; in other words, nouns whose adjective-noun combinations were under-predicted by their individual word probabilities. 

To find these nouns, we estimated the probability $p(A)$ of each adjective from our set of 26 by computing its relative frequency in an adjective-noun sequence in the BNC. We then computed the relative frequency of each noun $p(N)$ occurring in an adjective-noun sequence. Finally, we estimated the predicted joint probability of each adjective-noun combination by taking the product of each individual probability estimate: $\hat{p}(A,N) = p(A)\cdot p(N)$. Comparing  $\hat{p}(A,N)$ to the empirically estimated $p(A,N)$ establishes which adjective-noun combinations are under-predicted---more collocational---and thus likely to name complex concepts. We then restricted nouns to those 50 that maximize the observed range of under-predictedness while simultaneously requiring that each noun be attested to occur with at least 11 of the 26 adjectives; from these 50 nouns, we selected the following four: \emph{apple, cheese, eyes, hair}. (Recall that \emph{cheese} occurred in our original materials, where it suggested possible by-noun effects with the adjectives \emph{hard} and \emph{soft}.) To these four nouns we added a fifth: \emph{thing}.
While \emph{thing} did not occur in the top 50, it did occur naturalistically with the most adjectives (23) out of the set of 26, thus allowing it to serve as a filler for the various object descriptions. The selected nouns, together with the number of adjectives they occur with, their range of ratios of empirical to predicted joint probabilities, and their minimum / maximum ratios, are shown in Table \ref{tab:nouns}.

\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{l c c c c}
\toprule
Noun & \# of adjectives & range of ratios & minimum ratio & maximum ratio\\
\midrule
thing & 23 & 10.4 & 0.1 & 10.5 \\
eyes & 18 & 120.6 & 0.12 & 120.7 \\
hair & 15 & 82.9 & 0.03 & 83.0 \\
cheese & 13 & 114.0 & 0.4 & 114.4 \\
apple & 11 & 674.0 & 1.1 & 675.1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{For each chosen noun, the number of adjectives (out of 26) that it occurs with; and for each adjective $A$ that the noun occurs with, the range of ratios $p(A,N) / \hat{p}(A,N)$ (empirical to predicted probability of occurrence); the minimum ratio; and the maximum ratio.}
\label{tab:nouns}
\end{table}




\paragraph{Results.}

To evaluate the role of specific noun information in determining ordering preferences, we performed the same nested linear model comparison from our original naturalness ratings experiment. The models we compared predicted naturalness ratings either by \textsc{adjective} (i.e., the adjective farthest from the noun) only, or by \textsc{adjective} together with its interaction with \textsc{noun} (i.e., the modified noun).
The model comparison revealed that noun-specific ratings did not explain any additional variance in ordering preference beyond adjective-level ratings ($F(1,225) = 0.93, p < 0.75$).  Thus, we again fail to find evidence of noun-specific effects on ordering preferences, this time in our new materials. 

\section*{Experiment S2: Subjectivity}

We next set out to replicate the finding that subjectivity predicts adjective ordering preferences in our new materials.

\paragraph{Participants.}

We recruited 40 participants through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing service. Participants were compensated for their participation.

\paragraph{Design and methods.}

This experiment was a direct replication of our original faultless disagreement subjectivity experiment (Experiment 3), using the new set of nouns from the previous experiment.

\paragraph{Results.}

To evaluate the power of subjectivity in predicting adjective ordering preferences, we compared our new adjective subjectivity scores to the naturalness ratings collected in the previous experiment. 
Faultless disagreement scores account for  84\% of the variance in the new naturalness ratings ($r^2$ 0.84, 95\% CI [0.64,  0.91]; Fig.~\ref{fig:faultless}). 
As with our original materials, more subjective adjectives are preferred farther from the noun; subjectivity again predicts adjective ordering preferences.
