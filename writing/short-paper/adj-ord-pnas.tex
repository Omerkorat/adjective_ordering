\section{Behavioral Experiments}
	
\subsection{Subjectivity} We conducted experiment 1 to measure the subjectivity of adjectives and the broader classes to which they belong. Participants evaluated the potential for faultless disagreement between two differing descriptions of an object (\emph{Experiment 1a: Faultless Disagreement}). For example, an experimental trial might have Mary assert ``that apple is old,'' then have Bob counter with ``that apple is not old.'' To the extent that both Mary and Bob can be right in their descriptions of the apple, ``old'' admits that degree of faultless disagreement. In other words, to the extent that two people might disagree about a description without one necessarily being wrong, that description is subjective. We validated our faultless disagreement measure in a separate paradigm, which explicitly asked about the potential ``subjectivity'' of an object description like ``old apple'' (\emph{Experiment 1b: Subjectivity}). The results of these two methods are highly correlated with each other ($r^{2} = 0.89$), suggesting that the measures they invoke converge in their estimation of adjective subjectivity.

Fig.~\ref{faultless-class} plots faultless disagreement ratings for adjectives and their respective classes. Based on these aggregate scores, we infer the adjective class subjectivity raking in \ref{inferred-subjectivity}.
\be quality \geq size > texture \geq age > color > shape \geq material \label{inferred-subjectivity}\ee

\subsection{Ordering preferences}
We have so far established a connection between adjective subjectivity (measured in experiment 1) and adjective proximity to nouns (obtained from corpus counts). Our next task is to verify the adjective ordering preferences that we have inferred from the corpus and from the literature on the topic, and to evaluate the predictive power of subjectivity in determining adjective order. To that end, we elicited naturalness judgments on adjective-adjective-noun object descriptions, permuting the relative order of the adjectives (\emph{Experiment 2: Ordering Preferences}). Participants indicated which ordering of an adjective-adjective-noun object description (e.g., ``the big red apple'' vs.\ ``the red big apple'') sounded more natural. 

On the basis of these naturalness ratings, we computed for each adjective-adjective pairing its preferred, canonical order. We then determined how often an adjective from a given class occurred first in an adjective-adjective-noun configuration; Fig.\ \ref{class-distance-by-adj} plots these average distance scores, where a value of 2 signals that a class's adjectives always occur first in preferred adjective-adjective-noun orderings, and a value of 1 indicates that a class's adjectives always occur second, closest to the noun.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{plots/class_distance_by_adj.eps}
	\caption{Average distance from noun for each adjective class, determined by computing how often adjectives from a class occur first in preferred adjective-adjective-noun orderings.}\label{class-distance-by-adj}
\end{figure}

Finally, and most directly related to our hypothesis concerning adjective subjectivity in ordering preferences, we compared acceptability ratings from the current experiment with faultless disagreement scores from Expt.\ 1. To do so, we first calculated a difference score for each class configuration, \textsc{class1}--\textsc{class2}, subtracting the average faultless disagreement score for \textsc{class1} from the average faultless disagreement score for \textsc{class2}. Fig.\ \ref{faultless-order} plots class configuration acceptability ratings against faultless disagreement difference scores.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{plots/faultless_order_preference.eps}
	\caption{By-class adjective order preferences plotted against difference in faultless disagreement.}\label{faultless-order}
\end{figure}






 We then compared these naturalness judgments with the subjectivity scores.

For each pair of adjective classes, we determine the preferred ordering on the basis of the ratio of ratings for the each order. Ratio scores greater than 1 indicate the preferred ordering; these ratio scores for the preferred orderings are plotted in Fig.\ \ref{order-ratio}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{plots/order_ratio.eps}
	\caption{Accpetability ratios for the preferred adjective class orderings.}\label{order-ratio}
\end{figure}

On the basis of these preferred orderings, we may calculate the average distance from noun for each class, plotted in Fig.\ \ref{class-distance}. Comparing Fig.\ \ref{class-distance} with the corpus-based distance scores reported in Fig.\ \ref{distance-from-noun} confirms the reliability of the current paradigm: we replicate near exactly the qualitative order of adjective class distance from noun.

	\includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{plots/class_distance.eps}
	\caption{Average distance from noun for each adjective class calculated from order preference ratings.}\label{class-distance}
\end{figure}

We may infer the order preferences in \ref{expt-inferred-order-preferences} (cf.\ the preferences inferred from corpus counts in \ref{inferred-order-preferences} above).

\section{Experiment 1b: Subjectivity}

\section{Experiment 2: Ordering preferences}
We recruited 50 participants through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing service. Participants were compensated for their participation.

Participants were asked to indicate which of two descriptions of an object sounded more natural. Each description featured a noun modified by two adjectives, for example ``the red small chair'' or ``the small red chair''. Description pairs contained the same words, with relative adjective order reversed. Descriptions were random combinations of two adjectives and a noun from the list in Table \ref{stim-table} (compiled via the procedure described in Section \ref{corpus}), with the constraint that no description contained adjectives from the same adjective class.
On each trial, participants indicated which description sounded more natural by adjusting a slider whose endpoints were labeled with the competing descriptions; an example trial appears in Fig.\ \ref{order-trial}.
