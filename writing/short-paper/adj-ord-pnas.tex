\significancetext{Speakers exhibit robust ordering preferences when it comes to modification involving more than one adjective. We present experimental and corpus results showing that these preferences track the subjectivity of the adjectives at play such that less subjective adjectives occur closer to the nouns they modify. Rather than representing these preferences as a fully specified ranking according to semantic classes, we show that ordering preferences more likely emerge from a desire to place more informative, less subjective content closer to the substanstive head of a nominal construction (i.e., closer to the modified noun).}

\dropcap{L}inguistic competence encompasses a broad swath of information that determines the language we speak. The information, grammar, is ``mentalistic'' \cite{chomsky1965}; we observe it through the regularities in behavior of speakers and speech communities. Here we take up one such regularity, adjective ordering preferences, which determines the relative order of prenominal adjectives when more than one is used to modify a noun (e.g., ``big blue box''). The topic has received considerable attention throughout the history of generative grammar XXX and cognitive psychology XXX, owing to its remarkable stability within and across languages. Something so robust, the reasoning goes, must evidence a deep principle of the cognitive architecture that shapes language. Yet while descriptions of the phenomenon abound, an explanation continues to prove elusive. The current work serves to focus attention on what we believe to be the main determinant of these preferences: adjective subjectivity. We begin with a summary of the phenomenon of interest.

\section{Background}
Speakers exhibit strong preferences when two or more adjectives are used to modify a noun, as in ``the big blue box'' or ``the good smooth purple plastic chair.'' Deviate from the preferred order, and the construction becomes marked; somethings feels particularly unwieldy about ``the blue big box,'' even more so with ``the plastic good purple smooth chair.'' Indeed, for any string of pre-nominal adjectives, chances are their order is non-arbitrary. Linguists have been aware of adjective ordering preferences (or restrictions; often abbreviated ``AOR'') for well over a century now \cite{sweet1898,bloomfield1933}. Even more curious than their robustly attested status in English is their cross-linguistic regularity, observed in languages as far-flung as Celtic \cite{sproatshih1991} and Indonesian \cite{martin1969competence}. There have been two styles of approaches to determining the factors that underlie these cross-linguistically stable preferences: the psychological approach, appealing to general cognitive principles, and the grammatical approach, appealing to properties of language to map, as it were, the terrain of adjective structure. We review each style of approach in turn, then discuss how the approach we take here adopts aspects of both.
\subsection{Psychology}
The descriptions of ordering preferences that have so far been proffered are nearly as diverse as the principles to which they appeal (see \cite{wulff2003} for a comprehensive review of the many potential factors contributing to adjective order in production). Kicking off the enterprise, \cite{sweet1898} proposed two principles: that adjectives which are more closely connected with the noun in meaning occur more closely to the noun, and that adjectives with a more specialized meaning occur closer to the noun. \cite{ziff1960} proposed two others: that adjectives with a less context-dependent meaning occur more closely to the noun, and that adjectives that felicitously describe a narrower set of nouns occur more closely to the noun. Unfortunately, operationalizing metrics like meaning distance, specificity, and context-dependence is not a trivial task. However, in an attempt to do just that, \cite{martin1969determinants} expands on the proposal from \cite{ziff1960} and uses behavioral experiments to demonstrate that adjective order depends on adjective ``definiteness'' (i.e., context-dependence) and ``absoluteness,'' a correlate of definiteness operationalized by the number of comparisons needed to judge whether an object holds the specified property (see also \cite{kemmereretal2009} XXX).
While researchers may disagree about its details, the psychological explorations of ordering preferences converge on the idea that aspects of  adjectives' meaning (i.e., specificity, context-sensitivity, reliance on comparison, etc.) interact with general cognitive principles to determine their relative order. For a psychological theory of ordering preferences to get off the ground, we would need a mapping hypothesis between specific aspects of meaning and the cognitive principles that attend to them.

In an attempt to relate the relevant aspects of adjective meaning with observed ordering preferences, Martin \cite{martin1969competence,martin1969determinants} proposed a model of language production under which more accessible adjectives are retrieved earlier, and derivations are built outward from the noun. In other words, more accessible adjectives occur closer to the nouns that they modify. Crucial to this model is the hypothesis that less context-dependent adjectives and adjectives that are less sensitive to comparison are more accessible during production. When accessibility is not obeyed, non-canonical orderings occur, signaled by a ``juncture,'' or pause, in the rhythm of the phrase, as in ``the blue, big box'' \cite{martin1970}.

While it provides a plausible link between the semantic factors at play and the planning of multi-adjective strings that determines their relative order, we see two problems with Martin's accessibility model. The first concerns the inverse planning that the model implicates, namely a bottom-up construction, rather than a linear parse. A more serious problem concerns adjective frequency: as Martin himself notes, more frequent adjectives are more likely to occur early, that is, farther from the noun they modify (see  \cite{wulff2003} for a similar finding).  But if accessibility tracks frequency and more accessible adjectives occur closer to the noun, we should find, contrary to fact, that more frequent adjectives occur later in multi-adjective strings. Even if we were to grant Martin the not uncontroversial assumption that context-dependency directly correlates with ease of retrieval, it would seem that accessibility alone cannot predict ordering preferences.

Haiman \cite{haiman1985} proposes instead that adjective ordering preferences are symptomatic of a more general semiotic coding strategy called ``diagrammatic iconicity'' (i.e., non-arbitrary form-meaning mappings). This theory holds that distance relations in semantic space may be mapped onto distance relations in syntactic space, such that adjectives further from the noun in meaning occur farther from the noun syntactically. To move from a philosophical to a psychological theory, however, Haiman's proposal would require specifying just how more definite, less context-sensitive adjectives are closer in meaning to the nouns they modify. Indeed, a semiotic approach like Haiman's harkens back to Sweet's original description of the phenomenon of ordering preferences, namely that adjectives closer in meaning to the noun occur linearly closer to it \cite{sweet1898}. The question remains: in what sense are nominal and adjectival meaning comparable, and why should distance in meaning relate to linear distance in production?

To summarize, psychological approaches to adjective ordering focus on the aspects of meaning and cognition that would generate the observed preferences. They contrast with grammatical approaches, which focus instead on the adjectives themselves. We turn to them next.

\subsection{Grammar}
As part of a larger project mapping the syntax and semantics of adjectives (a ``cartographic'' approach, one could say), in the 1980s the literature on ordering preferences marks a turn away from the psychological determinants of ordering preferences, and toward a universal ordered typology of semantic classes of adjectives. These classes divide on the basis of the properties named by the adjectives that populate them (e.g., size, shape, color). At the heart of this enterprise is R.~Dixon \cite{dixon1982}, who argues that by prioritizing the study of adjective semantics, we may gain insight into properties of their syntactic distribution; one such property that semantics is meant to inform concerns their relative order in multi-adjective strings. After surveying a wealth of languages, Dixon arrives the adjective classes (or ``types'') in \ref{dixon-order}.\footnote{Here are some representative examples of Dixon's semantic classes:\\ \textit{dimension}: ``big'', ``small''; \textit{physical property}: ``hard'', ``heavy''; \textit{speed}: ``fast'', ``slow''; \textit{human propensity}: ``happy'', ``clever''; \textit{age}: ``new'', ``young''.} He furthermore ranked these classes according to their distance from the noun they modify; in multi-adjective strings, higher ranked adjectives occur farther from the modified noun.
\[
dimension > physical\ property > speed > 
\]
\be human\ propensity > age > color\label{dixon-order}\ee
While the ranking in \ref{dixon-order} is meant to characterize English preferences, Dixon notes that evidence of this ranking also surfaces in Hungarian (Uralic) and Telugu (Dravidian). Interestingly, in Selepet (Papuan), where adjectives typically occur post-nominally, the order in \ref{dixon-order} is preserved in the reverse, such that higher ranked adjectives occur farther to the right of the modified noun. 

Using a smaller and perhaps more transparently labeled set of semantic classes, \cite{sproatshih1991} proposed the ranking in \ref{ss-order}.
\be quality > size > shape > color > provenance\label{ss-order}\ee
In addition to English, the authors show that this ordering surfaces with pre-nominal adjectives in Mandarin Chinese, Dutch, and Kannada (Dravidian). And in Mokilese (Micronesian), a language like Selepet with post-nominal multi-adjective strings, the ordering in \ref{ss-order} is once again preserved in the reverse. Languages from all over the world exhibit ordering preferences, and, whether or not adjectives occur pre- or post-nominally, these preferences attend to distance from the modified noun.\footnote{For evidence of these preferences in yet more languages, see \cite{martin1969competence,hetzron1978,lapollahuang2004}.)}

In addition to the well-behaved languages mentioned above, Sproat and Shih discuss the potentially puzzling case of Celtic languages. In Irish and Welsh, adjectives occur post-nominally and there are preferred adjective orders (cf. Mokilese and Selepet), but the preferences preserve the English-like ranking and thereby reverse the scale in \ref{ss-order}: higher-ranked adjectives occur  \emph{closer} to the noun. The authors explain this pattern by appealing to a core property of Celtic VSO languages: both verbs and noun are ``fronted,'' moving to a phrase-initial position \cite{sproat1985,guilfoyle1987}. Assuming that Celtic nouns begin to the right of the adjectives that modify them, then front to a phrase-initial position to their left, the ordering preferences in Celtic languages evidence a planning trajectory that orders adjectives before finalizing the placement of the noun they modify; distance from the modified noun---albeit at an intermediate stage of planning---is still the key to the process.

On the basis of adjective class rankings like in \ref{dixon-order} and \ref{ss-order}, \cite{cinque1994} proposed a fully syntactic account of ordering preferences under which different adjective classes populate dedicated syntactic categories which inhabit specialized projections in the syntactic tree (see also \cite{scott2002}).\footnote{The class ranking Cinque uses as the basis for his syntactic proposal follows the ranking from \cite{sproatshih1991} in \ref{ss-order}: 
	\be quality > size > shape > color > nationality\label{cinque-order}\ee}
For example, color adjectives would inhabit the Color category, and project a Color Phrase; shape adjectives would project a Shape Phrase, which dominates the Color Phrase. Left-branching structure has hierarchical dominance result in linear precedence. Deviations from the standard structure require yet more structure (e.g., movement to dedicated focus projections), which results in a marked interpretation. The ultimate source of this rigid structure is left up for grabs; what matters is a comprehensive and deterministic theory of the facts.

In comparison to the psychological approaches we first considered, these grammatical approaches are primarily concerned with uncovering structure---both semantic and syntactic---by which to organize ordering preferences. Where psychological approaches are focused on the mind from which these preferences emerge, grammatical approaches target the language in which they operate, a system which the linguistics tradition has described in terms of structural rules.

\subsection{The upshot} Our approach to the investigation of ordering preferences synthesizes strategies from the psychological approach, probing the principles that underlie these preferences, and from the grammatical approach, using descriptive adjective classes to structure and inform our hypotheses. We selected a class of relatively frequent adjectives from a range of semantic classes and asked 1) whether they exhibit ordering preferences, and 2) what those preferences are. We then entertained the hypothesis that aspects of adjective meaning shape ordering preferences. Our intuition, which we investigate experimentally, was that adjective subjectivity---how easy it is for different speakers to arrive at different judgments for the same property---predicts ordering preferences. Less subjective adjectives are reliably more informative, and these more informative adjectives occur closer to the substantive head on the nominal projection, that is, to the noun.

\section{Experiment 1: Corpus counts}

We first conducted a corpus study to measure, for 26 adjectives from seven different semantic classes discussed in the grammatical literature (size, quality, age, texture, shape, color, material), what their mean distance from the noun is in phrases with either two or three adjectives preceding the noun (e.g., ``a nice green color'' or ``some big heavy red cloaks''). We extracted all such cases from the Switchboard corpus and the British National Corpus (see \emph{Materials and Methods} for details). Mean distance from the noun for each adjective class is shown in Fig.~\ref{results}; higher values indicate that adjectives from that class tend to appear farther from the modified noun.

To infer an ordering that could be compared with orders reported in the literature, we conducted pairwise Bonferroni-corrected comparisons on the mean distance-from-noun scores calculated in Fig.~\ref{results}; these comparisons yielded the following ordering preferences:
\be size \geq quality > age > texture > shape > color > material \label{inferred-order-preferences}\ee
Our inferred order closely tracks previous reports (cf.~the orders in \ref{dixon-order},\ref{ss-order}). Taking corpus counts as a proxy for preferences in production such that preferred orders get produced more often, we thus find support for active and stable ordering preferences in speakers. However, the source of these preferences and the level of representation that they target remains a mystery: the stable ordering observed in corpora could emerge from superficial production pressures (e.g., relative frequency or accessibility), rather than deep cognitive principles. To test the awareness and thus robustness of these preferences in language, we next shifted focus from speakers to listeners.

\section{Experiment 2: Ordering preferences}
Finding evidence for ordering preferences in speakers, we then asked whether meta-linguistic awareness of these preferences exists in listeners. Finding as much, we would have evidence for the psychological reality of ordering preferences. To that end, we elicited naturalness judgments on adjective-adjective-noun object descriptions, permuting the relative order of the adjectives. Participants indicated which ordering of an adjective-adjective-noun object description (e.g., ``the big red apple'' vs.\ ``the red big apple'') sounded more natural. We used the same adjectives from the corpus experiment, paired with a sets of nouns describing either food or furniture (see \emph{Materials and Methods} for details).

On the basis of these naturalness ratings, we computed for each adjective-adjective pairing its preferred, canonical order (i.e., the order that sounded more natural to listeners). We then determined how often an adjective from a given semantic class occurred first in a preferred  configuration; Fig.\ \ref{results} plots these mean preference scores, where a value of 1 signals that a class's adjectives always occur first in preferred adjective-adjective-noun orderings, and a value of 0 indicates that a class's adjectives always occur second, closest to the noun. This preferred distance measure replicated the qualitative order inferred from the corpus counts in the first experiment. We therefore conclude that, like speakers, listeners possess active and stable ordering preferences, suggesting that the source of these preferences concerns more than just pressures during production. And given the remarkable similarity, both qualitative and quantitative, between the results of the current experiment and the distance measures computed in Experiment 1, we furthermore conclude that generalizing to the level of semantic classes proves useful in characterizing the phenomenon of interest.

\end{figure}

\section{The content and source of ordering preferences}

Having established the robustness of ordering preferences both in speakers (Experiment 1) and in listeners (Experiment 2), we then shifted focus to the details of these preferences: where do they come from (e.g., psychological pressures vs.~properties of grammar), how are they represented (e.g., a full rank ordering vs.~a general heuristic), and what do they target (e.g., lexical items vs.~semantic classes)? Addressing the latter two questions first, arguments from parsimony---both for theory's simplicity and for the sake of the language users who must ultimately learn to use the preferences---suggest a clear path forward: the resources required to exhaustively rank lexical items (i.e., all pre-nominal adjectives) according to their preferred ordering would be all but limitless. We therefore consider it much more likely that general heuristics apply at a level of abstraction (e.g., at the level of semantic classes) to determine, for any pairing of adjectives, its preferred order.  Indeed, the results of our experiments have demonstrated the success of characterizing these preferences at the level of abstract semantic classes.

But what is this heuristic that determines adjective order, and where does it come from? Even if the heuristic were encoded as a domain-specific principle of grammar, there must have been some pressure to do so. While researchers disagree about the details, psychological explorations of ordering preferences have converged on the idea that aspects of  adjectives' meaning (e.g., specificity, context-sensitivity, reliance on comparison) determine their relative order \cite{sweet1898,ziff1960,martin1969determinants,martin1969competence,martin1970,kemmereretal2009}. Returning to the ordering preferences we observed in our first two experiments (cf.~Fig.~\ref{results}),
we distilled the proposals that precede us into a single feature: the subjectivity of the property named. In each of the observed preferred orderings, intuition suggests that less subjective adjectives appear closer to the modified noun. 
	
\section{Experiment 3: Subjectivity} 

To test our subjectivity hypothesis, we had participants judge the subjectivity of adjectives (and the classes to which they belong) using a faultless disagreement measure. Participants evaluated the potential for disagreement between two speakers concerning differing descriptions of an object, without either speaker being wrong. For example, an experimental trial would have Mary assert, ``That apple is old,'' then have Bob counter with ``That apple is not old.'' 
To the extent that both Mary and Bob can be right in their descriptions of the apple, ``old'' admits that degree of faultless disagreement. 
Thus, the extent to which two people can disagree about a description without one necessarily being wrong determines the subjectivity of that description. 
We validated the faultless disagreement measure in a separate paradigm in which participants rated the ``subjectivity'' of object descriptions like ``old apple'' directly; the results of these two methods were highly correlated ($r^{2} = 0.89$), suggesting that the measures they invoke converge in their estimation of adjective subjectivity.

Fig.~\ref{results} (subjectivity) plots mean faultless disagreement ratings for adjectives and their respective classes. These subjectivity scores closely track the distance measures from Experiments 1 and 2, with the exception that color adjectives are judged more subjective than shape adjectives, yet color adjectives tend to appear closer to the modified noun (e.g., ``the round purple desk'' vs.~``the purple round desk''). Curiously, the relative subjectivity of shape vs.~color adjectives was one of the areas where our two measures pulled apart; with the direct ``subjectivity'' measure, shape is rated higher than color, in line with the distance measures from Experiments 1 and 2.

To more directly evaluate the power of subjectivity in predicting adjective order, we compared naturalness ratings (Experiment 2) to faultless disagreement scores. We  computed a subjectivity difference score for each class configuration (i.e., an ordered pairing of two adjective classes, \textsc{class1}-\textsc{class2}) by subtracting the mean faultless disagreement score for \textsc{class2} from the mean faultless disagreement score for \textsc{class1}. Higher difference scores indicate that the adjective class closer to the noun is less subjective than the class farther away. Fig.~\ref{faultless-order} plots naturalness ratings  against these faultless disagreement difference scores; the two measures are highly correlated ($r^2$ = 0.81), strongly supporting the hypothesis that less subjective adjectives occur more closely to the noun.

\section{Discussion}

Adjective ordering preferences have received considerable attention throughout the history of generative grammar and cognitive psychology, owing to its remarkable stability within and across languages. Something so robust, the reasoning goes, must evidence a deep principle of the cognitive architecture that shapes language. Yet while descriptions of the phenomenon abound, an explanation continues to prove elusive. Our findings serve to narrow the space of possible explanations: rather than representing these preferences as a fully specified ranking according to semantic classes or syntactic projections, our results demonstrate that ordering preferences more likely emerge from a desire to place more informative, less subjective content closer to the substantive head of a nominal construction (i.e., closer to the modified noun).

\section{Corpus counts} 

We used TGrep2 \cite{rohde2005} and the TGrep2 Database Tools \cite{degenjaeger-tdt} to extract all ``A A N" and ``A A A N" NPs that contained one of the 26 adjectives in Table \ref{TABLREFER} from the Penn Treebank subset of the Switchboard corpus of telephone dialogs \cite{godfrey1992} as well as from the spoken and the written portions of the British National Corpus (\red{REF}). There were a total of 35,721 cases. For these cases, we computed the distance of each occurrence of our 26 target adjectives from the noun, yielding results for a total of 39,199 adjectives (180 from Switchboard, 2,232 from the spoken BNC, 36,787 from the written BNC).  See \tableref{tab:adjdist} for the distribution of cases over adjective classes.

\begin{table}
	\caption{Distribution of cases extracted from corpora over adjective classes}
	\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c}
	\textbf{Class} & age & size & color & quality & texture & material & shape \\
	\textbf{Count} & 15,688 & 11,576 & 5,024 & 3,790 & 1,720 & 1, 183 & 218 \\
	\textbf{Proportion} & .40 & .30 & .13 & .10 & .04 & .03 & .01
	\end{tabular}
\label{tab:adjdist}
\end{table}


For each adjective class, mean distance from the noun was computed (where position directly preceding the noun was coded as 0, the position preceding that as 1, etc.). The resulting by-class mean distances are shown in \figref{fig:distance}. To determine which differences between adjective classes are meaningful differences, we conducted Bonferroni-corrected pairwise t-tests. All differences were significant at the .0001 level except for the difference between color and shape (significant at the .04 level) and the difference between size and quality (not significant). See \tableref{tab:bonferronicorpus} for a summary. These results suggest that except for the exact position of size and quality, the order established in \figref{fig:distance} is real.

\section{Experiment 1b: Subjectivity}

\section{Experiment 2: Ordering preferences}
We recruited 50 participants through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing service. Participants were compensated for their participation.

Participants were asked to indicate which of two descriptions of an object sounded more natural. Each description featured a noun modified by two adjectives, for example ``the red small chair'' or ``the small red chair''. Description pairs contained the same words, with relative adjective order reversed. Descriptions were random combinations of two adjectives and a noun from the list in Table \ref{stim-table} (compiled via the procedure described in Section \ref{corpus}), with the constraint that no description contained adjectives from the same adjective class.
On each trial, participants indicated which description sounded more natural by adjusting a slider whose endpoints were labeled with the competing descriptions; an example trial appears in Fig.\ \ref{order-trial}.

We then compared these naturalness judgments with the subjectivity scores.

For each pair of adjective classes, we determine the preferred ordering on the basis of the ratio of ratings for the each order. Ratio scores greater than 1 indicate the preferred ordering; these ratio scores for the preferred orderings are plotted in Fig.\ \ref{order-ratio}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{plots/order_ratio.eps}
	\caption{Accpetability ratios for the preferred adjective class orderings.}\label{order-ratio}
\end{figure}

On the basis of these preferred orderings, we may calculate the average distance from noun for each class, plotted in Fig.\ \ref{class-distance}. Comparing Fig.\ \ref{class-distance} with the corpus-based distance scores reported in Fig.\ \ref{distance-from-noun} confirms the reliability of the current paradigm: we replicate near exactly the qualitative order of adjective class distance from noun.

We may infer the order preferences in \ref{expt-inferred-order-preferences} (cf.\ the preferences inferred from corpus counts in \ref{inferred-order-preferences} above).
