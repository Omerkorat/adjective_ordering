\dropcap{I}ntoduction\ldots summary of the literature on adjective ordering preferences.


\section{Corpus Counts}

We first conducted a corpus study to measure, for 26 adjectives from seven different classes discussed in the literature (size, quality, age, texture, shape, color, material), what their mean distance from the noun is in phrases with either two or three adjectives preceding the noun, e.g., ``a nice green color'' or ``some big heavy red cloaks''. We extracted all such cases from the Switchboard corpus as well as from both the written and spoken portions of the British National Corpus (see \emph{Materials and Methods} for details). Mean distance from the noun for each adjective class is shown in \figref{fig:distance}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{plots/corpus_distance_plot.eps}
	\caption{Average distance from noun by adjective class for cases with at least two modifying adjectives (39,199 cases).}\label{distance-from-noun}
	\label{fig:distance}
\end{figure}

Conducting pairwise Bonferroni-corrected comparisons between classes on the average distance-from-noun scores calculated in \figref{fig:distance} yields the following ordering preferences:

\be size \geq quality > age > texture > shape > color > material \label{inferred-order-preferences}\ee

This order \red{is identical to/closely tracks} the order previously documented \ref{REFS}.

\section{Behavioral Experiments}
	
\subsection{Subjectivity} We conducted experiment 1 to measure the subjectivity of adjectives and the broader classes to which they belong. Participants evaluated the potential for faultless disagreement between two differing descriptions of an object (\emph{Experiment 1a: Faultless Disagreement}). For example, an experimental trial might have Mary assert ``that apple is old,'' then have Bob counter with ``that apple is not old.'' To the extent that both Mary and Bob can be right in their descriptions of the apple, ``old'' admits that degree of faultless disagreement. In other words, to the extent that two people might disagree about a description without one necessarily being wrong, that description is subjective. We validated our faultless disagreement measure in a separate paradigm, which explicitly asked about the potential ``subjectivity'' of an object description like ``old apple'' (\emph{Experiment 1b: Subjectivity}). The results of these two methods are highly correlated with each other ($r^{2} = 0.89$), suggesting that the measures they invoke converge in their estimation of adjective subjectivity.

Fig.~\ref{faultless-class} plots faultless disagreement ratings for adjectives and their respective classes. Based on these aggregate scores, we infer the adjective class subjectivity raking in \ref{inferred-subjectivity} on the basis of pairwise comparisons between classes.
\be quality \geq size > texture \geq age > color \geq shape \geq material \label{inferred-subjectivity}\ee

	\caption{Average distance from noun for each adjective class, determined by computing how often adjectives from a class occur first in preferred adjective-adjective-noun orderings.}\label{faultless-class}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Ordering preferences}
We have so far established a connection between adjective subjectivity (measured in experiment 1) and adjective proximity to nouns (obtained from corpus counts). Our next task is to verify the adjective ordering preferences that we have inferred from the corpus and from the literature on the topic, and to evaluate the predictive power of subjectivity in determining adjective order. To that end, we elicited naturalness judgments on adjective-adjective-noun object descriptions, permuting the relative order of the adjectives (\emph{Experiment 2: Ordering Preferences}). Participants indicated which ordering of an adjective-adjective-noun object description (e.g., ``the big red apple'' vs.\ ``the red big apple'') sounded more natural. 

On the basis of these naturalness ratings, we computed for each adjective-adjective pairing its preferred, canonical order. We then determined how often an adjective from a given class occurred first in an adjective-adjective-noun configuration; Fig.\ \ref{class-distance-by-adj} plots these average distance scores, where a value of 2 signals that a class's adjectives always occur first in preferred adjective-adjective-noun orderings, and a value of 1 indicates that a class's adjectives always occur second, closest to the noun.
\be size \geq quality > texture \geq age > color > shape > material \label{inferred-preference}\ee

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{plots/class_distance_by_adj.eps}
	\caption{Average distance from noun for each adjective class, determined by computing how often adjectives from a class occur first in preferred adjective-adjective-noun orderings.}\label{class-distance-by-adj}
\end{figure}

Finally, and most directly related to our hypothesis concerning adjective subjectivity in ordering preferences, we compared acceptability ratings from the current experiment with faultless disagreement scores from Expt.\ 1. To do so, we first calculated a difference score for each class configuration, \textsc{class1}--\textsc{class2}, subtracting the average faultless disagreement score for \textsc{class1} from the average faultless disagreement score for \textsc{class2}. Fig.\ \ref{faultless-order} plots class configuration acceptability ratings against faultless disagreement difference scores.

\section{Discussion}



\begin{materials}
\section{Corpus counts} 

We used TGrep2 \cite{rohde2005} and the TGrep2 Database Tools \cite{degenjaeger-tdt} to extract all ``A A N" and ``A A A N" NPs that contained one of the 26 adjectives in Table \ref{TABLREFER} from the Penn Treebank subset of the Switchboard corpus of telephone dialogs \cite{godfrey1992} as well as from the spoken and the written portions of the British National Corpus (\red{REF}). There were a total of 35,721 cases. For these cases, we computed the distance of each occurrence of our 26 target adjectives from the noun, yielding results for a total of 39,199 adjectives (180 from Switchboard, 2,232 from the spoken BNC, 36,787 from the written BNC).  See \tableref{tab:adjdist} for the distribution of cases over adjective classes.

\begin{table}
	\caption{Distribution of cases extracted from corpora over adjective classes}
	\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c}
	\textbf{Class} & age & size & color & quality & texture & material & shape \\
	\textbf{Count} & 15,688 & 11,576 & 5,024 & 3,790 & 1,720 & 1, 183 & 218 \\
	\textbf{Proportion} & .40 & .30 & .13 & .10 & .04 & .03 & .01
	\end{tabular}

		\label{tab:adjdist}
\end{table}

For each adjective class, mean distance from the noun was computed (where position directly preceding the noun was coded as 0, the position preceding that as 1, etc.). The resulting by-class mean distances are shown in \figref{fig:distance}. To determine which differences between adjective classes are meaningful differences, we conducted Bonferroni-corrected pairwise t-tests. All differences were significant at the .0001 level except for the difference between color and shape (significant at the .04 level) and the difference between size and quality (not significant). See \tableref{tab:bonferronicorpus} for a summary. These results suggest that except for the exact position of size and quality, the order established in \figref{fig:distance} is real.

\section{Experiment 1b: Subjectivity}

\section{Experiment 2: Ordering preferences}
We recruited 50 participants through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing service. Participants were compensated for their participation.

Participants were asked to indicate which of two descriptions of an object sounded more natural. Each description featured a noun modified by two adjectives, for example ``the red small chair'' or ``the small red chair''. Description pairs contained the same words, with relative adjective order reversed. Descriptions were random combinations of two adjectives and a noun from the list in Table \ref{stim-table} (compiled via the procedure described in Section \ref{corpus}), with the constraint that no description contained adjectives from the same adjective class.
On each trial, participants indicated which description sounded more natural by adjusting a slider whose endpoints were labeled with the competing descriptions; an example trial appears in Fig.\ \ref{order-trial}.

\begin{figure}[h!]

Only native speakers of English with IP addresses located within the United States were included in the analyses; we analyzed data from 45 participants.

We then compared these naturalness judgments with the subjectivity scores.

For each pair of adjective classes, we determine the preferred ordering on the basis of the ratio of ratings for the each order. Ratio scores greater than 1 indicate the preferred ordering; these ratio scores for the preferred orderings are plotted in Fig.\ \ref{order-ratio}.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.95\linewidth]{plots/order_ratio.eps}
	\caption{Accpetability ratios for the preferred adjective class orderings.}\label{order-ratio}
\end{figure}

On the basis of these preferred orderings, we may calculate the average distance from noun for each class, plotted in Fig.\ \ref{class-distance}. Comparing Fig.\ \ref{class-distance} with the corpus-based distance scores reported in Fig.\ \ref{distance-from-noun} confirms the reliability of the current paradigm: we replicate near exactly the qualitative order of adjective class distance from noun.
