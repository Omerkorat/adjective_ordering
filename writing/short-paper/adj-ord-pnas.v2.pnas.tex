{The relative order of adjectives in multi-adjective strings is stable not only among speakers within a language, but among speakers across languages. We advance the hypothesis that adjective meaning, specifically the subjectivity of the properties that the adjectives name, determines ordering preferences.

\dropcap{R}egularities in the behavior of speakers and speech communities provide a window onto the psychology of language. Here we take up one such regularity: adjective ordering. Speakers and listeners exhibit strong preferences when two or more adjectives are used to modify a noun, as in ``the big blue box'' or ``the good smooth purple plastic chair.'' Deviate from the preferred order, and the construction becomes marked. Something feels particularly unwieldy about ``the blue big box,'' even more so with ``the plastic good purple smooth chair.'' Indeed, for any string of adjectives, chances are their order is non-arbitrary. The question is why. We investigate the role of adjective meaning, specifically the subjectivity of the properties that the adjectives name, in predicting ordering preferences.

Adjective ordering preferences stand as a particularly striking case of regularity in language. More remarkable than their robustness in English is their cross-linguistic systematicity: we continually find the \emph{same} preferences across the world's languages. Hungarian (Uralic), Telugu (Dravidian), Mandarin Chinese, and Dutch are just a handful of languages with pre-nominal adjectives (i.e., languages where adjectives precede nouns) reported to have the same ordering preferences as English \cite{dixon1982,sproatshih1991,martin1969competence,hetzron1978,lapollahuang2004}.  In languages like Selepet (Papuan) and Mokilese (Micronesian) with post-nominal adjectives (i.e., where adjectives follow nouns), these preferences are preserved in the reverse \cite{dixon1982,sproatshih1991}. The preferences determine the linear distance of an adjective from the noun it modifies.

There have been two styles of approaches to the investigation of adjective ordering preferences. 
As part of a larger project mapping the syntax and semantics of adjectives (a ``cartographic'' approach, one could say), in the 1980s the linguistics literature began to advance a universal hierarchy of semantic classes of adjectives. Leading the charge, Dixon set out to uncover language-internal structure by which to organize ordering preferences \cite{dixon1982}. The preferences were assumed to be universal and hard-coded in the grammar; the researcher's job was simply to uncover them. 
Building on the ordering of semantic classes proposed by Dixon \cite{dixon1982}, Cinque advanced a fully syntactic account of ordering preferences under which different classes of adjectives populate dedicated syntactic categories which inhabit specialized projections in the syntactic tree \cite{cinque1994}. For example, color adjectives project a Color Phrase, shape adjectives project a Shape Phrase. The Shape Phrase syntactically dominates the Color Phrase; with left-branching structure, hierarchical dominance results in linear precedence. The ultimate source of this rigid structure was immaterial; at issue was a comprehensive and deterministic account of the facts.

In contrast to the grammatical approaches, which map, as it were, the terrain of adjective structure, psychological approaches advance the idea that aspects of adjectives' meaning determine their relative order. The trouble lies in deciding precisely which aspects of meaning. Kicking off the enterprise in 1898, Sweet proposed that adjectives which are more closely connected with the noun in meaning occur closer to the noun, and that adjectives with a more specialized meaning occur closer to the noun \cite{sweet1898}. Similarly, Whorf proposed that adjectives describing more ``inherent'' properties occur closer to the noun \cite{whorf1947}. Ziff proposed that adjectives with less context-dependent meaning occur closer to the noun, and that adjectives that felicitously describe a narrower set of nouns occur closer to the noun \cite{ziff1960}. The proposals and many others like them \cite{XXX} circle around similar aspects of adjective meaning in their account of ordering preferences; unfortunately, operationalizing metrics like meaning distance, specificity, inherence, and context-dependence is not a trivial task (but see the attempts in \cite{martin1969determinants}). Without clear empirical constructs of the aspects of adjective meaning that were meant to determine ordering preferences, these psychological accounts gave way to the more descriptive, grammatical ones that settle for innate syntax as the ultimate arbiter.  %Moreover, the , for a psychological theory of ordering preferences to get off the ground, we would need a mapping hypothesis between the relevant aspects of meaning and the cognitive processes that attend to them.

Rather than falling back on a rigid syntax, we attempt to revive the idea that ordering preferences emerge from aspects of adjective meaning. We adopt strategies from the grammatical approach, using semantic classes of adjectives to structure and inform our investigation, while advancing a psychological account of the preferences. We distill the psychological proposals that precede us into a single feature and advance the hypothesis that it is the subjectivity of the property named that determines ordering preferences.
 The extent to which two people can disagree about a description without one necessarily being wrong determines the subjectivity of that description.
 Less subjective adjectives are reliably more informative; there is little question about what the speaker meant to communicate. These more informative adjectives occur closer to the substantive head of the nominal projection, that is, to the modified noun.  In ``the big blue box,'' judgments about bigness are likely less consistent than judgments about blueness; ``blue'' is less subjective than ``big,'' and so it occurs closer to the noun ``box.''

To test the hypothesis that adjective subjectivity predicts ordering preferences, we validated two key empirical constructs: 1) the ordering preferences themselves, and 2) an adjective's subjectivity. With reliable estimates of both, we then evaluated the predictive power of subjectivity in adjective ordering preferences.

\section{Ordering preferences}

We began by measuring the ordering preferences. We selected a sample of 26 relatively frequent adjectives from seven different semantic classes discussed in the grammatical literature (size, quality, age, texture, shape, color, material). We then elicited naturalness judgments on adjective-adjective-noun object descriptions, permuting the relative order of the adjectives. Participants (n=45) indicated which ordering of an object description sounded more ``natural'' (e.g., ``the big red apple'' vs.\ ``the red big apple;'' see \emph{Materials and Methods} for details).

For each adjective, we computed its mean naturalness score by averaging ratings to configurations in which it appeared in fist position, farthest from the noun. Fig.\ \ref{results} (\emph{naturalness}) plots these mean naturalness scores by adjective class; greater values signal that a class's adjectives are preferred more in first position, while lower value indicate that a class's adjectives are preferred in second position, closer to the noun. This preferred distance measure closely tracks ordering hierarchies reported in the literature \cite{dixon1982,sproatshih1991}.

To independently validate our behavioral measure of ordering preferences, we conducted a corpus study on the same 26 adjectives and measured their mean distance from the noun in phrases with two adjectives. We extracted 38,418 cases from the Switchboard Corpus and the British National Corpus (see \emph{Materials and Methods} for details). Mean distance from the noun for each adjective class is shown in Fig.~\ref{results} (\emph{corpus}); higher values indicate that adjectives from the specified class tend to appear farther from the modified noun. The corpus measure closely tracks the qualitative pattern we measured in our naturalness experiment; quantitatively, the two measures are highly correlated ($r^{2}=0.83$, 95\% CI [0.63, 0.90]), in spite of the fact that the corpus measure includes cases from a superset of the nouns tested in our naturalness experiment. Our naturalness ratings thus serve as valid empirical constructs of speakers' ordering preferences.

\section{Subjectivity}

Next, we measured adjective subjectivity. To establish an ecologically valid measure, we operationalized subjectivity as the potential for faultless disagreement between two speakers. We had participants (n=40) evaluate whether two speakers could both be right while asserting conflicting object descriptions. For example, an experimental trial would have Mary assert, ``That apple is old,'' then have Bob counter with ``That apple is not old;'' 
participants rated whether both Mary and Bob could be right, or whether one of them must be wrong (see \emph{Materials and Methods} for more details). This measure, the faultless disagreement potential for the adjective at issue, serves as our empirical construct of adjective subjectivity. Fig.\ \ref{results} (\emph{faultless}) plots these scores by adjective class, where a value of 1 signals that a class's adjectives are always amenable to faultless disagreement (i.e., maximally subjective), and a value of 0 indicates that a class's adjectives are never amenable to faultless disagreement (i.e., minimally subjective).

We validated our faultless disagreement measure in a separate paradigm with a more direct yet potentially less ecologically valid measure of adjective subjectivity: participants were asked explicitly to rate the ``subjectivity'' of object descriptions like ``old apple'' (see \emph{Materials and Methods} for details). The results of this method (Fig.~\ref{results}, \emph{subjectivity}) were highly correlated with our faultless disagreement scores ($r^{2} = 0.89$, 95\% CI [0.82, 0.93]), suggesting that the measures they invoke converge in their estimation of adjective subjectivity. We therefore take our faultless disagreement scores as valid empirical constructs of subjectivity.

\section{Predicting adjective order}

To evaluate the power of subjectivity in predicting adjective ordering preferences, we compared our naturalness ratings to the faultless disagreement scores. At the level of individual adjectives, faultless disagreement scores account for 88\% of the variance in the naturalness ratings data ($r^2$ = 0.88, 95\% CI [0.77, 0.95]; Fig.~\ref{naturalness-faultless-pred}). 
%At the class level, faultless disagreement scores account for 86\% of the variance ($r^2$ = 0.86, 95\% CI [0.36, 0.99]).
More subjective adjectives are preferred farther from the noun; subjectivity indeed predicts adjective ordering preferences.

One might worry that conducting our analysis at the level of individual adjectives obscures information about the configurations of adjective pairs that participants rated in our naturalness experiment.
We therefore computed a subjectivity difference score for each adjective class configuration (i.e., an ordered pairing of two adjective classes, \textsc{class1}-\textsc{class2}) by subtracting the mean faultless disagreement score for \textsc{class2} from the mean faultless disagreement score for \textsc{class1}. Higher difference scores indicate that the adjective class closer to the noun is less subjective than the class farther away. Fig.~\ref{naturalness-faultless} plots mean naturalness ratings for adjective class configurations against these faultless disagreement difference scores; the two measures are highly correlated ($r^2$ = 0.82, 95\% CI [0.71, 0.88]). Performing the same analysis on specific adjective configurations, we find that faultless disagreement difference scores predict 70\% of the variances in the rating data ($r^2$ = 0.70, 95\% CI [0.67, 0.74]). Computing the correlation of the 
naturalness rating data with itself revealed that only 82\% of its variance is explainable (i.e., not due to noise; see \emph{Materials and Methods} for details); the fact that faultless disagreement difference scores account for 70\% of the naturalness rating variance strongly supports our hypothesis that less subjective adjectives occur more closely to the noun. 

\section{Discussion}

Adjective ordering preferences have received considerable attention throughout the history of generative grammar and cognitive psychology, owing to their remarkable stability within and across languages. Something so robust, the reasoning goes, must evidence a deep principle of the cognitive architecture that shapes language. Yet while descriptions of the phenomenon abound, an explanation continues to prove elusive. Grammatical theories that posit a rigid syntax of adjective classes offer little more than a reminder of the facts, and psychological approaches stumble when it comes to operationalizing the specific aspects of adjective meaning at play. 

In our investigation, we established two empirical constructs: the preferences themselves, which we measured using naturalness ratings and validated with corpus counts; and adjective subjectivity, which we operationalized as potential for faultless disagreement and validated with a direct ``subjectivity'' measure. Our findings suggest a clear path forward: an adjective's semantics can indeed predict its distance from the modified noun, such that less subjective adjectives occur linearly closer to nouns they modify. Rather than representing these preferences as a rigid, fully specified ranking according to semantic classes or syntactic projections, these results demonstrate that ordering preferences more likely emerge from a desire to place less subjective content closer to the substantive head of a nominal construction (i.e., closer to the modified noun). For now we can only speculate about the ultimate source of this desire: less subjective content is reliably more useful at communicating about the world. Subjective content is potentially less informative because it allows for miscommunication that might arise if speakers and listeners arrive at different judgments about a property description. The robust tendency that results consolidates informative descriptions (i.e., less subjective adjectives) around the noun that names the object being described.


\begin{materials}
\section{Experiment 1: Naturalness ratings}	
We recruited 50 participants through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing service. Participants were paid \$0.30 for their participation.
Participants were asked to indicate which of two descriptions of an object sounded more natural. Each description featured a noun modified by two adjectives, for example ``the red small chair'' or ``the small red chair''. Description pairs contained the same words, with relative adjective order reversed. Descriptions were random combinations of two adjectives and a noun from the list in Table \ref{stim-table}, with the constraint that no description contained adjectives from the same semantic class.
On each trial, participants indicated their choice by adjusting a slider with endpoints labeled with the competing descriptions; an example trial appears in Fig.\ \ref{order-trial}. Participants completed 26 trials; on each trial we obtained two data points, one for each scale endpoint.  Only native speakers of English with IP addresses located within the United States were included in the analyses; we analyzed data from 45 participants.

\section{Experiment 2: Corpus counts} 
We used TGrep2 \cite{rohde2005} and the TGrep2 Database Tools \cite{degenjaeger-tdt} to extract all ``A A N"  NPs that contained one of the 26 adjectives in Table \ref{stim-table} from the Penn Treebank subset of the Switchboard corpus of telephone dialogues \cite{godfrey1992}, as well as from the spoken and the written portions of the British National Corpus (\red{REF}). For these cases, we computed the distance of each occurrence of our 26 target adjectives from the modified noun, yielding results for a total of 38,418 adjective tokens.  For each adjective, mean distance from the noun was computed (where the position directly preceding the noun was coded as 0, and the position preceding that was coded as 1). The same procedure was used to compute mean distance by adjective class.
%To determine which differences between adjective classes are meaningful differences, we conducted Bonferroni-corrected pairwise t-tests. All differences were significant at the .0001 level except for the difference between color and shape (significant at the .04 level) and the difference between size and quality (not significant). See \tableref{tab:bonferronicorpus} for a summary. These results suggest that except for the exact position of size and quality, the order established in \figref{fig:distance} is real.

\section{Experiment 3: Faultless disagreement}
We recruited 40 participants through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing service. Participants were paid \$0.35 for their participation. Participants saw a series of short dialogues in which speakers disagreed about an object that they both could see.  Their task was to determine ``whether one speaker must be wrong, or whether both speakers can be right'' using a sliding scale. Speaker names were chosen at random. The object name was randomly chosen from the set of nouns in Table \ref{stim-table}, and the predicate was randomly chosen from the set of adjectives. Whether the initial statement was positive or negative was chosen at random for each trial. In the example trial in Fig.~\ref{faultless-trial}, the initial statement is negative, the predicate is ``tiny,'' and the noun is ``couch.'' Participants completed a total of 26 trials, one for each of the adjectives in Table \ref{stim-table}.
All 40 participants were native speakers of English with IP addresses located within the United States, so we analyzed data from all 40 participants.

\section{Experiment 4: Direct subjectivity}
We recruited 30 participants through Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing service. Participants were paid \$0.30 for their participation. Participants were shown a series of adjective-noun descriptions and asked to indicate how ``subjective'' each description was on a sliding scale (Fig.~\ref{subjectivity-trial}). Descriptions contained random pairings of adjectives and nouns from the list in Table \ref{stim-table}. Participants completed a total of 26 trials, one for each adjective. All 30 participants were native speakers of English with IP addresses located within the United States, so we analyzed data from all 30 participants.

\section{Predicting adjective order}
To compute the explainable variance in the naturalness rating data, we first computed the split-half correlation of the data to itself. To do so, we chose a random sample of 13 participants, then correlated their data with the data from the remaining 12 participants. We repeated this process 100 times; the mean split-half correlation of our data was 0.70. To ``step up'' the split-half correlation to provide an estimated correlation of the data with itself, we entered this value into the Spearman-Brown Prophecy formula \cite{stanley1971}. The result, 0.82, signals that 82\% of the rating data is explainable, that is, not due to noise.

We then compared these naturalness judgments with the subjectivity scores.

For each pair of adjective classes, we determine the preferred ordering on the basis of the ratio of ratings for the each order. Ratio scores greater than 1 indicate the preferred ordering; these ratio scores for the preferred orderings are plotted in Fig.\ \ref{order-ratio}.

	\caption{Accpetability ratios for the preferred adjective class orderings.}\label{order-ratio}
\end{figure}

On the basis of these preferred orderings, we may calculate the average distance from noun for each class, plotted in Fig.\ \ref{class-distance}. Comparing Fig.\ \ref{class-distance} with the corpus-based distance scores reported in Fig.\ \ref{distance-from-noun} confirms the reliability of the current paradigm: we replicate near exactly the qualitative order of adjective class distance from noun.

We may infer the order preferences in \ref{expt-inferred-order-preferences} (cf.\ the preferences inferred from corpus counts in \ref{inferred-order-preferences} above).
\be
size > quality > age > texture > shape > color > material\label{expt-inferred-order-preferences}\ee 


To infer an ordering that could be compared with orders reported in the literature, we conducted pairwise Bonferroni-corrected comparisons on the mean distance-from-noun scores calculated in Fig.~\ref{results}; these comparisons yielded the following ordering preferences:
\be size \geq quality > age > texture > shape > color > material \label{inferred-order-preferences}\ee
Our inferred order closely tracks previous reports (cf.~the orders in \ref{dixon-order},\ref{ss-order}). Taking corpus counts as a proxy for preferences in production such that preferred orders get produced more often, we thus find support for active and stable ordering preferences in speakers. However, the source of these preferences and the level of representation that they target remains a mystery: the stable ordering observed in corpora could emerge from superficial production pressures (e.g., relative frequency or accessibility), rather than deep cognitive principles. To test the awareness and thus robustness of these preferences in language, we next shifted focus from speakers to listeners.



replicated the qualitative order inferred from the corpus counts in the first experiment. We therefore conclude that, like speakers, listeners possess active and stable ordering preferences, suggesting that the source of these preferences concerns more than just pressures during production. And given the remarkable similarity, both qualitative and quantitative, between the results of the current experiment and the distance measures computed in Experiment 1, we furthermore conclude that generalizing to the level of semantic classes proves useful in characterizing the phenomenon of interest.

1) whether they exhibit ordering preferences, and 2) what those preferences are. We then entertained the hypothesis that aspects of adjective meaning shape ordering preferences. Our intuition, which we validate empirically, was that adjective subjectivity---how easy it is for different speakers to arrive at different judgments for the same property---predicts ordering preferences. 






Fig.~\ref{results} (subjectivity) plots mean faultless disagreement ratings for adjectives and their respective classes. These subjectivity scores closely track the distance measures from Experiments 1 and 2, with the exception that color adjectives are judged more subjective than shape adjectives, yet color adjectives tend to appear closer to the modified noun (e.g., ``the round purple desk'' vs.~``the purple round desk''). Curiously, the relative subjectivity of shape vs.~color adjectives was one of the areas where our two measures pulled apart; with the direct ``subjectivity'' measure, shape is rated higher than color, in line with the distance measures from Experiments 1 and 2.



, owing to its remarkable stability within and across languages. Something so robust, the reasoning goes, must evidence a deep principle of the cognitive architecture that shapes language. Yet while descriptions of the phenomenon abound, an explanation continues to prove elusive. 

\section{Background}
Linguists have been aware of adjective ordering preferences (or restrictions; often abbreviated ``AOR'') for well over a century now \cite{sweet1898,bloomfield1933}. Even more curious than their robustly attested status in English is their cross-linguistic regularity, observed in languages as far-flung as Celtic \cite{sproatshih1991} and Indonesian \cite{martin1969competence}. 

We review each style of approach in turn, then discuss how the approach we take here adopts aspects of both.
\subsection{Psychology}
The descriptions of ordering preferences that have so far been proffered are nearly as diverse as the principles to which they appeal (see \cite{wulff2003} for a comprehensive review of the many potential factors contributing to adjective order in production). 


Haiman \cite{haiman1985} proposes instead that adjective ordering preferences are symptomatic of a more general semiotic coding strategy called ``diagrammatic iconicity'' (i.e., non-arbitrary form-meaning mappings). This theory holds that distance relations in semantic space may be mapped onto distance relations in syntactic space, such that adjectives further from the noun in meaning occur farther from the noun syntactically. To move from a philosophical to a psychological theory, however, Haiman's proposal would require specifying just how more definite, less context-sensitive adjectives are closer in meaning to the nouns they modify. Indeed, a semiotic approach like Haiman's harkens back to Sweet's original description of the phenomenon of ordering preferences, namely that adjectives closer in meaning to the noun occur linearly closer to it \cite{sweet1898}. The question remains: in what sense are nominal and adjectival meaning comparable, and why should distance in meaning relate to linear distance in production?

To summarize, psychological approaches to adjective ordering focus on the aspects of meaning and cognition that would generate the observed preferences. They contrast with grammatical approaches, which focus instead on the adjectives themselves. We turn to them next.

\subsection{Grammar}
These classes divide on the basis of the properties named by the adjectives that populate them (e.g., size, shape, color). At the heart of this enterprise is R.~Dixon \cite{dixon1982}, who argues that by prioritizing the study of adjective semantics, we may gain insight into properties of their syntactic distribution; one such property that semantics is meant to inform concerns their relative order in multi-adjective strings. After surveying a wealth of languages, Dixon arrives the adjective classes (or ``types'') in \ref{dixon-order}.\footnote{Here are some representative examples of Dixon's semantic classes:\\ \textit{dimension}: ``big'', ``small''; \textit{physical property}: ``hard'', ``heavy''; \textit{speed}: ``fast'', ``slow''; \textit{human propensity}: ``happy'', ``clever''; \textit{age}: ``new'', ``young''.} He furthermore ranked these classes according to their distance from the noun they modify; in multi-adjective strings, higher ranked adjectives occur farther from the modified noun.
\[
dimension > physical\ property > speed > 
\]
\be human\ propensity > age > color\label{dixon-order}\ee
While the ranking in \ref{dixon-order} is meant to characterize English preferences, Dixon notes that evidence of this ranking also surfaces in Hungarian (Uralic) and Telugu (Dravidian). Interestingly, in Selepet (Papuan), where adjectives typically occur post-nominally, the order in \ref{dixon-order} is preserved in the reverse, such that higher ranked adjectives occur farther to the right of the modified noun. 

Using a smaller and perhaps more transparently labeled set of semantic classes, \cite{sproatshih1991} proposed the ranking in \ref{ss-order}.
\be quality > size > shape > color > provenance\label{ss-order}\ee
In addition to English, the authors show that this ordering surfaces with pre-nominal adjectives in Mandarin Chinese, Dutch, and Kannada (Dravidian). And in Mokilese (Micronesian), a language like Selepet with post-nominal multi-adjective strings, the ordering in \ref{ss-order} is once again preserved in the reverse. Languages from all over the world exhibit ordering preferences, and, whether or not adjectives occur pre- or post-nominally, these preferences attend to distance from the modified noun.\footnote{For evidence of these preferences in yet more languages, see \cite{martin1969competence,hetzron1978,lapollahuang2004}.)}

In addition to the well-behaved languages mentioned above, Sproat and Shih discuss the potentially puzzling case of Celtic languages. In Irish and Welsh, adjectives occur post-nominally and there are preferred adjective orders (cf. Mokilese and Selepet), but the preferences preserve the English-like ranking and thereby reverse the scale in \ref{ss-order}: higher-ranked adjectives occur  \emph{closer} to the noun. The authors explain this pattern by appealing to a core property of Celtic VSO languages: both verbs and noun are ``fronted,'' moving to a phrase-initial position \cite{sproat1985,guilfoyle1987}. Assuming that Celtic nouns begin to the right of the adjectives that modify them, then front to a phrase-initial position to their left, the ordering preferences in Celtic languages evidence a planning trajectory that orders adjectives before finalizing the placement of the noun they modify; distance from the modified noun---albeit at an intermediate stage of planning---is still the key to the process.

\footnote{The class ranking Cinque uses as the basis for his syntactic proposal follows the ranking from \cite{sproatshih1991} in \ref{ss-order}: 
	\be quality > size > shape > color > nationality\label{cinque-order}\ee}
For example, 



\subsection{The upshot} Our approach to the investigation of ordering preferences synthesizes strategies from the psychological approach, probing the principles that underlie these preferences, and from the grammatical approach, using descriptive adjective classes to structure and inform our exploration and hypothesis. We selected a class of relatively frequent adjectives from a range of semantic classes and asked 1) whether they exhibit ordering preferences, and 2) what those preferences are. We then entertained the hypothesis that aspects of adjective meaning shape ordering preferences. Our intuition, which we validate empirically, was that adjective subjectivity---how easy it is for different speakers to arrive at different judgments for the same property---predicts ordering preferences. Less subjective adjectives are reliably more informative; there is little question about what the speaker meant to communicate. These more informative adjectives occur closer to the substantive head on the nominal projection, that is, to the noun.

\section{Experiment 1: Corpus counts}



\section{Experiment 2: Ordering preferences}
Finding evidence for ordering preferences in speakers, we then asked whether meta-linguistic awareness of these preferences exists in listeners. Finding as much, we would have evidence for the psychological reality of ordering preferences. To that end, we elicited naturalness judgments on adjective-adjective-noun object descriptions, permuting the relative order of the adjectives. Participants indicated which ordering of an adjective-adjective-noun object description (e.g., ``the big red apple'' vs.\ ``the red big apple'') sounded more natural. We used the same adjectives from the corpus experiment, paired with a sets of nouns describing either food or furniture (see \emph{Materials and Methods} for details).

On the basis of these naturalness ratings, we computed for each adjective-adjective pairing its preferred, canonical order (i.e., the order that sounded more natural to listeners). We then determined how often an adjective from a given semantic class occurred first in a preferred  configuration; Fig.\ \ref{results} plots these mean preference scores, where a value of 1 signals that a class's adjectives always occur first in preferred adjective-adjective-noun orderings, and a value of 0 indicates that a class's adjectives always occur second, closest to the noun. This preferred distance measure replicated the qualitative order inferred from the corpus counts in the first experiment. We therefore conclude that, like speakers, listeners possess active and stable ordering preferences, suggesting that the source of these preferences concerns more than just pressures during production. And given the remarkable similarity, both qualitative and quantitative, between the results of the current experiment and the distance measures computed in Experiment 1, we furthermore conclude that generalizing to the level of semantic classes proves useful in characterizing the phenomenon of interest.

\section{The content and source of ordering preferences}

Having established the robustness of ordering preferences both in speakers (Experiment 1) and in listeners (Experiment 2), we then shifted focus to the details of these preferences: where do they come from (e.g., psychological pressures vs.~properties of grammar), how are they represented (e.g., a full rank ordering vs.~a general heuristic), and what do they target (e.g., lexical items vs.~semantic classes)? Addressing the latter two questions first, arguments from parsimony---both for theory's simplicity and for the sake of the language users who must ultimately learn to use the preferences---suggest a clear path forward: the resources required to exhaustively rank lexical items (i.e., all pre-nominal adjectives) according to their preferred ordering would be all but limitless. We therefore consider it much more likely that general heuristics apply at a level of abstraction (e.g., at the level of semantic classes) to determine, for any pairing of adjectives, its preferred order.  Indeed, the results of our experiments have demonstrated the success of characterizing these preferences at the level of abstract semantic classes.

But what is this heuristic that determines adjective order, and where does it come from? Even if the heuristic were encoded as a domain-specific principle of grammar, there must have been some pressure to do so. While researchers disagree about the details, psychological explorations of ordering preferences have converged on the idea that aspects of  adjectives' meaning (e.g., specificity, context-sensitivity, reliance on comparison) determine their relative order \cite{sweet1898,ziff1960,martin1969determinants,martin1969competence,martin1970,kemmereretal2009}. Returning to the ordering preferences we observed in our first two experiments (cf.~Fig.~\ref{results}),
we distilled the proposals that precede us into a single feature: the subjectivity of the property named. In each of the observed preferred orderings, our intuition suggests that less subjective adjectives appear closer to the modified noun. For example, people might disagree about whether or not something counts as big or good or old, less so for square or blue or wooden. The latter set appears reliably closer to the noun than the former set.

\section{Experiment 3: Subjectivity} 

To test our subjectivity hypothesis, we had participants judge the subjectivity of adjectives (and the classes to which they belong) using a faultless disagreement measure. Participants evaluated the potential for disagreement between two speakers concerning differing descriptions of an object, without either speaker being wrong. For example, an experimental trial would have Mary assert, ``That apple is old,'' then have Bob counter with ``That apple is not old.'' 
To the extent that both Mary and Bob can be right in their descriptions of the apple, ``old'' admits that degree of faultless disagreement. 
Thus, the extent to which two people can disagree about a description without one necessarily being wrong determines the subjectivity of that description. 
We validated the faultless disagreement measure in a separate paradigm in which participants rated the ``subjectivity'' of object descriptions like ``old apple'' directly; the results of these two methods were highly correlated ($r^{2} = 0.89$), suggesting that the measures they invoke converge in their estimation of adjective subjectivity.

Fig.~\ref{results} (subjectivity) plots mean faultless disagreement ratings for adjectives and their respective classes. These subjectivity scores closely track the distance measures from Experiments 1 and 2, with the exception that color adjectives are judged more subjective than shape adjectives, yet color adjectives tend to appear closer to the modified noun (e.g., ``the round purple desk'' vs.~``the purple round desk''). Curiously, the relative subjectivity of shape vs.~color adjectives was one of the areas where our two measures pulled apart; with the direct ``subjectivity'' measure, shape is rated higher than color, in line with the distance measures from Experiments 1 and 2.

To more directly evaluate the power of subjectivity in predicting adjective order, we compared naturalness ratings (Experiment 2) to faultless disagreement scores. We  computed a subjectivity difference score for each class configuration (i.e., an ordered pairing of two adjective classes, \textsc{class1}-\textsc{class2}) by subtracting the mean faultless disagreement score for \textsc{class2} from the mean faultless disagreement score for \textsc{class1}. Higher difference scores indicate that the adjective class closer to the noun is less subjective than the class farther away. Fig.~\ref{faultless-order} plots naturalness ratings  against these faultless disagreement difference scores; the two measures are highly correlated ($r^2$ = 0.81), strongly supporting the hypothesis that less subjective adjectives occur more closely to the noun.
