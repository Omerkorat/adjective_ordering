	Abstract = {The base position of adjective phrases (APs) in Romance {\&} Germanic$\backslash$nlanguages is argued to be to the left of the noun, {\&} the different$\backslash$nsurface position in the languages is attributed to the raising of$\backslash$nthe N in Romance languages, but not in Germanic - to a functional$\backslash$nhead intermediate between N {\&} D across some of the APs. This notion$\backslash$nis supported by the distribution of thematic APs that express the$\backslash$nexternal theta-role of a N; in Romance languages, the only order$\backslash$nadmitted is with the AP intervening between the N {\&} its complement.$\backslash$nAnother support is provided by the distribution of attributive APs.$\backslash$nWhereas they necessarily precede the N in Germanic, they are found$\backslash$neither preceding or following the N in Romance. This does not imply$\backslash$nthat APs in Romance can be freely generated both to the left {\&} the$\backslash$nright of the N {\&} its complement, as there is evidence that the AP$\backslash$ncases constitute a predicative type of modification, which is found$\backslash$nto the right of the N {\&} its complements in Germanic as well. A specific$\backslash$nunmarked serialization of the different classes of APs {\&} the existence$\backslash$nof a clear limit on the number of noncoordinated attributive APs$\backslash$nwithin DP lead to the conclusion of generating the APs in distinct$\backslash$nspecifier positions. 65 References.

@article{Culbertson2014,
	Abstract = {Although it is widely agreed that learning the syntax of natural languages involves acquiring structure-dependent rules, recent work on acquisition has nevertheless attempted to characterize the outcome of learning primarily in terms of statistical generalizations about surface distributional information. In this paper we investigate whether surface statistical knowledge or structural knowledge of English is used to infer properties of a novel language under conditions of impoverished input. We expose learners to artificial-language patterns that are equally consistent with two possible underlying grammars--one more similar to English in terms of the linear ordering of words, the other more similar on abstract structural grounds. We show that learners' grammatical inferences overwhelmingly favor structural similarity over preservation of superficial order. Importantly, the relevant shared structure can be characterized in terms of a universal preference for isomorphism in the mapping from meanings to utterances. Whereas previous empirical support for this universal has been based entirely on data from cross-linguistic language samples, our results suggest it may reflect a deep property of the human cognitive system--a property that, together with other structure-sensitive principles, constrains the acquisition of linguistic knowledge.},

@article{Wulff2003,
	Abstract = {This paper is concerned with the question of which factors govern prenominal adjective order (AO) in English. In particular, the analysis aims to overcome shortfalls of previous analyses by, firstly, adopting a multifactorial approach integrating all variables postulated in the literature, thereby doing justice to the well-established fact that cognitive and psychological processes are multivariate and complex. Secondly, the phenomenon is investigated on the basis of a large corpus, rendering the results obtained more representative and valid of naturally occurring language than those of previous studies. To this end, corpus-linguistic operationalizations of phonological, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic determinants of AO are devised and entered into a Linear Discriminant Analysis, which determines the relative influence of all variables (semantic variables being most important) and yields a classification accuracy of 78{\%}. Moreover, by means of the operationalizations developed in this analysis, the ordering of yet unanalyzed adjective strings can be predicted with about equal accuracy (73.5{\%}). {\copyright} John Benjamins Publishing Company.},
